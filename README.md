# Maze Solver
Maze Solver is a C++ program that demonstrates maze generation using DFS and provides a maze-solving interface where users can navigate from the start ('@') to the end ('E') of the maze by entering directional commands ('D', 'L', 'R', 'U').
## Features 
- Maze generation using Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Interactive maze-solving interface.
- Randomized path generation for each run.
